# Deep Malware Analysis
Classifies if a PE is benign or a malware. If it is found to be a malware, the PE is then classified among the following three types:
1. Backdoor
2. Trojan
3. Rootkit

The dataset for malware analysis was formed from the database of [MalShare](https://malshare.com).

The following are the component files:

[application.py](https://github.com/hexterisk/deep-malware-analysis/blob/master/application.py): Flask RESTful API on which the project has been deployed.

[requirements.txt](https://github.com/hexterisk/deep-malware-analysis/blob/master/requirements.txt): Lists all the python libraries required. All of these can be installed via pip.

[features.py](https://github.com/hexterisk/deep-malware-analysis/blob/master/model/ember/features.py): Feature extraction script from the files in the dataset. Original script taken from the ember project and modified to apply various tweaks for multiclass classification and file specific signatures.

[dataset_builder.py](https://github.com/hexterisk/deep-malware-analysis/blob/master/model/dataset_builder.py): Builds the dataset from all the files in the database.

[malware_downloader.py](https://github.com/hexterisk/deep-malware-analysis/blob/master/model/malware_downloader.py): Script that scrapes pages of MalShare and downloads PEs from their database using their API.

[recomposer.py](https://github.com/hexterisk/deep-malware-analysis/blob/master/model/recomposer.py): Script to recompose a file's header, section names and inject random data to revamp a file.

[train.py](https://github.com/hexterisk/deep-malware-analysis/blob/master/model/train.py): A python script to train the model, given the data.

[transformer.py](https://github.com/hexterisk/deep-malware-analysis/blob/master/model/transformer.py): Transform the given files into vectorized features.
